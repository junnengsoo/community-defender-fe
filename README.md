# Introduction
CommunityDefender.AI is a call-taker AI assistant designed to streamline emergency calls, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding for call operators from start to finish. Before a live operator picks up, standardised questions will be asked, with the AI transcribing and summarising information from the caller, and flagging out potential life-threatening conditions. During the call, it assists operators by continuing to flag out potential life-threatening conditions while continuously transcribing conversations. Post-call, it provides live updates to the caller, monitors the situation for the operator while conversing with the caller if necessary, and reconnects back to the ops centre if the situation escalates.
